After finishing high school in 2012 I worked as a Sail-Making Apprentice before completing my Certificate 3 in Textile Fabrication at TAFE NSW to qualify as a Sail-Making Tradesman. I completed my Under Graduate degree in Social Sciences whilst working as a Sail-Making Tradesman, before moving on to begin work at the NSW Teachers Federation branch of the Australian Education Union. The majority of my time at NSWTF was spent working as a Professional Support Advisor.',
